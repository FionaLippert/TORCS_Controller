Learn reservoir weights of ESN

evaluation on: e-road, dirt4, e-track-2
trained on: forza, aalborg, e-track_5
D_RESERVOIR = 50
fitness: minimize (0.1*(sum of [distances from center > 0.9 shifted by 0.9 to get values in (0,0.1)]) - (sum of distances raced))
if distance raced = 0 for one or more tracks, use 0.1*(sum of distances raced)


cross-over: uniform (replaces each element with prob=0.05 by the element of the other parent). prob that cx is applied = 0.2
mutation: gaussian, mu=0, sigma=0.3, indpb=0.05, prob=0.5
selection: tournament with size=10
population_size=20
offspring=80
generations=30
